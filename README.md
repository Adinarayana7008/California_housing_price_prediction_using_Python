# California_housing_price_prediction_using_Python
Predict housing prices using the California housing dataset in Python.

## Objective
This is a California housing data set, which gives the data inputs and data drawn from the 1990 U.S. Census. The objective of the dataset is to predict the house prices based on the certain measures contained in the dataset.

### Variables/feature columns used in the dataset
**Longitude**: This variable gives the value of longitude and it is a continuous data type because we are measuring and it contains decimal values.

**Latitude**: This variable gives the value of latitude and it is a continuous data type because we are measuring and it contains decimal values.

**Housing_median_age**: This variable gives the value of median age group and it is a continuous data type because we are measuring and it contains decimal values.

**Total_rooms**: This variable gives the value of total rooms present and it is a discrete data type because we are counting and it doesn't contains decimal values. i.e. we don't count as half room.

**Total_bedrooms**: This variable gives the value of total bedrooms present and it is a discrete data type because we are counting and it doesn't contains decimal values. i.e. we don't count as half room.

**Population**: This variable gives the value of population and it is a discrete data type because we are counting and it doesn't contains decimal values.

**Households**: This variable gives the value of housholds and it is a discrete data type because we are counting and it doesn't contains decimal values.

**Median_income**: This variable gives the value median income and it is a continuous data type because we are measuring and it contains decimal values.

**Median_house_value**: This variable gives the value of median house and it is a continuous data type because we are measuring and it contains decimal values.

**Ocean_proximity**: This variable gives the ocean proximity and it is a nominal data type because we don't have any order and also magnitude.

### Findings
1. What is the average median income of the data set and check the distribution of data using appropriate plots? 
   Please explain the distribution of plot.
2. Draw an appropriate plot for housing_median_age and explain your observations.
3. Show with the help of visualization, how median_income and median_house_values are related?
4. Create a data set by deleting the corresponding examples from the data set for which total_bedrooms are not available.
5. Create a data set by filling the missing data with the mean value of the total_bedrooms in the original data set.
6. Write a programming construct to calculate the median value of the data set wherever required
7. Plot latitude versus longitude and explain your observations.
8. Create a data set for which the ocean_proximity is Near ocean.
9. Find the mean and median of the median income for the data set created in question 8.
10. Please create a new column named total_bedroom_size. If size 10 or less. It should be quoted as small. 
    If the size is 11 or more but 1000 less, it should be medium, otherwise it should be large.
